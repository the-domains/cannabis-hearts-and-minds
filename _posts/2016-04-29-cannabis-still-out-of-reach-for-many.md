# Many Still Lack Access to Cannabis 

But the world is listening.

Millions still lack access to cannabis around the world, but access to information has been enough to stir quiet, hidden movements and tacit use among highly educated populations everywhere. 

Take Vietnam, for example. Less than a century stands between today's youth and the rest of recorded history when cannabis was used widely as medicine as well as an object of spiritual/social significance across Asia. It should come as no surprise that today's educated elite are asking questions about prohibition, often over a smoke session. There's no doubt their behavior is partially influenced by cultural exchange at elite U.S. and other western schools where cannabis is accepted and beloved.

_Cannabis Sativa_ expanded as humans carried its genes over borders through the ages in a long game of survival-of-the-fittest whence sprang a cornucopia of diverse, highly distinct cousins.

Indeed, [genetic maps][0] allow researchers to trace strains to their geographic origins - with interesting results. Cannabis genomics underscores that modern cannabis is the result of a massive, voluntary human project that wasn't tied to only a few cultures. We now know that it was a shining example of global achievement through open-sourced collaboration.

Could prohibition have actually played a role in stimulating genetic variation? Forcing growers indoors with limited space may have caused even greater selective pressure on the cannabis genome. Recent prohibitions notwithstanding, the mega-project of cannabis selection has continued unabated for millennia across the world.
