# Cannabis Heavyweights Converge at Harvard

Key cannabis scientists met at the Harvard School of Medicine in April, 2016\. Their purpose was to share groundbreaking research in personalized medicine, mobile technologies, and cannabinoid-based therapies. 

The ['Cannamed 2016'][0] conference was met with intense interest in its inaugural year, attracting scholars from across the globe. The annual research conference showcases the "people, companies, and key thought leaders working with the endocannabinoid system and medical concepts for the use of cannabinoid therapeutics in neurological disorders."

The conference is sponsored by two high-end cannabis research companies, [Medical Genomics][1], & [Courtagen Life Sciences][2]. Among their ranks are award-winning researchers and leaders, like the founders of the Human Genome Project, who are now turning their attention to mapping the cannabis genome and finding new ways to treat neurological disorders like epilepsy, autism, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and many more.
