Take a look at the western fine art world, and you may notice that cannabis is now an object of awe, envy, and intrigue. Artists in growing numbers spot hope through the crumbling ramparts of prohibition as they zoom in on cannabis.

## Art, Inspired by Science 

"Humans and cannabis are old friends. The cannabis of today was created by people for people. When I see how humans and cannabis have evolved together, it requires me to look deeper as an artist and respect a process that began thousands of years ago." Herb Wilson, who spoke those words in April 20th, 2016, is a photographer in New York City. In his new series, '_Fragrance & Grace_' he hopes to capture the "nuanced, aromatic, distinguished genetics born out of the massive scale of evolutionary time." Wilson noted, "It's like the subject of my art has been crafted by thousands of other artists over millennia and I'm just lucky to capture it."

Incredibly, much of the genetic variation in modern cannabis occurred in the last eighty-one hundred years. When growers were forced indoors with limited space, only the fittest survived.
